                        Hello there! I'm Hugh.  
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm a recent computer science graduate with a keen interest in <span class="bold">technology, productivity,</span> and <span class="bold">problem-solving.</span> 
                        I have spent a lifetime learning and cultivating a broad range of interests. This personal website will be my chance to share everything I know and love.

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    As a recent graduate, a big part of my identity is that of a student. 
                    And like most students, I am sometimes worried about being too inexperienced to call myself a "real" software developer. 
                    Fortunately, I'm <span class="bold">steadfast</span> and <span class="bold">ambitious.</span> As such, as I steadily transition into a professional role, 
                    I aim to grow out of these insecurities and sculpt myself into a competent programmer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dream has always been to work at a large company where I have the chance to learn from great industry professionals.
                    A big goal for me is to <span class="bold">prove myself</span> and <span class="bold">stand proudly</span> amongst my peers; I want to be recognized for my efforts and admired for my ability within the craft.
                    A lofty goal, I know, but it's an honest one.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So while l know that I'm just a growing bud in this industry, it won't stop me. 
                    It only makes me more excited to see what my future has in store for me.  
                </p>

                <h2>Philosophy</h2>
                <p>
                    <i>First and foremost,</i> I am a<span class="bold"> problem solver.</span> I develop solutions and bring value to my clients.
                    To do that, I always have an array of tools that are ready to use. My favourite? <span class="bold">Web Technologies.</span> 
                    At the moment, I am in <i>love</i> with front-end development; I find it to be the perfect blend of design and logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Secondly,</i><span class="bold"> I fix things.</span> The unfortunate reality is that things break, like, all the time. 
                    Our focus as developers isn't to just create new things but also <span class="bold">maintain</span> them.
                    It's one of the skills I strongly recommend <i>every</i> programmer practices - it <i>is</i> our job to fix things when they break.

                <p>
                    I've compiled a list of projects I've done over the years, either on my own or with a client.
                    I wanted to demonstrate how these projects have trained my <span class="bold">critical thinking, technical</span> and <span class="bold">communication skills.</span>

                <h2>What do I do in my spare time?</h2>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, learning about code or thinking about code, I like to preoccupy my myself with a variety of hobbies - usually something silly but still relaxing.
                    Recently, I've actually been getting into Cooking! I'm a terrible chef so when I'm not making the occasional dish, I usually prefer to watch other Chefs cook on the internet.
                    My favourite thing at the moment is <a href="https://thechefshow.com/" target="_blank">The Chef Show</a> presented by Jon Favreau and Chef Roy Choi. I've always been a fan of Jon ever since Iron Man but I just love Chef Roy's style of cooking.
                    It's just damn good television!
