                    <p>
                        Hello! I'm Hugh. Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. It ain't much right now but it's honest work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a recent computer science graduate with a keen interest in technology, productivity, and problem-solving. 
                        Although my professional career has just begun, I have spent a lifetime learning and cultivating a broad range of interests. 
                        This personal website will be my chance I share everything I know and love.

                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>
                    As a recent graduate, a large part of my identity is still that of a student. 
                    And like most students, I am sometimes worried about being too inexperienced to call myself a "real" software developer. 
                    Fortunately, I'm steadfast and ambitious. So, as I steadily transition into a professional role, 
                    I aim to grow out of my insecurities and sculpt myself into a competent programmer. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My dream has always been to work at a large company where I have the chance to learn from great industry professionals.
                    A big goal for me is to prove myself and stand proudly amongst my peers; I want to be recognized for my efforts and admired for my ability within the craft.
                    A lofty goal, I know, but it's an honest one.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    So while l know that I'm just a growing bud in this industry, it won't stop me. 
                    It only makes me more excited to see what my future has in store for me.

                <h2>What do I have to offer?</h2>
                <p>
                    First and foremost, I am a problem solver. I provide the solutions that get you, from where you are, to where you need to be.
                    And like any good problem solver, I have an array of tools that I tend to use. My favourite? Web Technologies. 
                    At the moment, I and in <i>love</i> with front-end development; I find it to be the perfect blend of design and logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second of all, things break. Like, all the time. 
                    As such, I've taken it upon myself to not just focus on creating things but also be good at <i>maintaining</i> them.
                    It's one of the skills I strongly recommend <i>every</i> programmer develops - it's crucial to know how to fix things when they break (not to mention marketable).

                <h2>What have I done?</h2>
                <p>
                    I've compiled a list of projects I've done over the years, either on my own or with a client.
                    I wanted to demonstrate how these projects have trained my critical thinking, technical and communication skills.

                <h2>What do I do in my spare time?</h2>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, learning about code or thinking about code, I like to preoccupy my myself with a variety of hobbies - usually something silly but still relaxing.
                    Recently, I've actually been getting into Cooking! I'm a terrible chef so when I'm not making the occasional dish, I usually prefer to watch other Chefs cook on the internet.
                    My favourite thing at the moment is "The Chef Show" presented by Jon Favreau and Chef Roy Choi. I've always been a fan of Jon ever since Iron Man but I just love Chef Roy's style of cooking.
                    It's just damn good television!
